# Real Hologram Creation

This section contains tutorials and guides for creating physical holograms using various methods.

## DIY Laser Holograms with LitiHolo Kits

### Overview
LitiHolo offers self-developing hologram kits that require no chemicals, making them perfect for beginners and educational use.

### Getting Started
1. **Order a LitiHolo Kit**: Available online, includes pre-coated film plates
2. **Set Up Your Workspace**: You'll need a stable surface and a laser pointer
3. **Follow the Kit Instructions**: Each kit comes with step-by-step guidance
4. **Expose and Develop**: The film develops automatically with exposure

## INTEGRAF Reflection & Transmission Holograms

### Reflection Holograms
Reflection holograms are viewed with white light and create images that appear to float in front of or behind the hologram plate.

**Setup Requirements:**
- Laser: HeNe (632.8 nm) or diode laser
- Beam splitter ratio: 50/50
- Object-to-plate distance: 5-20 cm
- Exposure time: Varies by laser power

**Processing Steps:**
1. Expose the plate
2. Develop using JD-2 or similar developer
3. Bleach to increase brightness
4. Dry and seal the plate

### Transmission Holograms
Transmission holograms require laser illumination for viewing and can display full parallax and depth.

**Setup Requirements:**
- Object and reference beam on opposite sides
- Beam ratio: 2:1 to 10:1 (reference:object)
- Stability: Critical - use vibration isolation

**Processing Steps:**
1. Chemical development
2. Fixing
3. Optional bleaching for efficiency

## Safety Considerations

### Laser Safety
- Always wear appropriate laser safety glasses
- Never look directly into the laser beam
- Use beam stops and attenuators
- Work in well-lit areas to constrict pupils
- Post warning signs when laser is in use

### Chemical Safety
- Work in well-ventilated areas
- Wear gloves and eye protection
- Follow MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets) for all chemicals
- Properly dispose of chemical waste

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Weak or No Image**
- Check laser coherence length
- Verify proper exposure time
- Ensure beam ratio is correct
- Check for vibration during exposure

**Blurry Image**
- Improve vibration isolation
- Reduce exposure time if object moved
- Check laser stability
- Verify focus of reference beam

**Fringes Not Visible**
- Increase exposure time
- Check beam alignment
- Verify coherence of laser source
- Ensure proper beam ratio
